FormCreator
===========

FormCreator is an engine with an interface to quickly create simple forms. The plugin is separated into two models: forms and aforms.
The forms model is the main model for the forms. The aforms is an extra model added in case the user needs to add a more complicated form,
they can write it and FormCreator will include it in the list of available forms.

The plugin's root is at http://{app}/forms. Here the application will show a list of the created forms and aforms, if there are any. 
Available options include viewing the form for submission, editing the forms fields, editing the form details, and viewing all form submissions.

Installation
============
Installation is simple, once you have the plugin in your plugin directory, run rake db:migrate:form_creator from your app root. This will generate the three tables that form_creator uses. Then you are good to go.
